//two strings can be concated or joined same way it is done in c++ or java

const weight = 58;
const user = "alok"

console.log(`My name is ${user} and my weight is ${weight}`);
//same as console.log("My name is "+user+ " and my weight is "+weight)

//This is primitive string
let x1 = "aqib";
let x2 = x1;
x2 = "ali"
console.log(x1);
//Note : This will not change , because string here primitive


//this is object string
// let x1 = new String("aqib")
//this will change when its refrence varibale is changed
