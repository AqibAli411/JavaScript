/*
variables in javascript can be defined using var,let and const

const cannot be changed

var and let can be changed but var is not used now a days because of issues faced by using it
->no concept of scope was being used..

It is better and advisible to use let than var

*/

//const thing cannot be changed
const gpa = 3.25;
let age = 19;
let nameOfStudent = "Aqib";
favoriteBook = "Stranger";


console.table([nameOfStudent, gpa, age, favoriteBook]);


//if a value is not initallized, then it is assigned as undefined
